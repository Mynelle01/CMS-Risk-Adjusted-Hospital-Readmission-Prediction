# **CMS-Risk-Adjusted-Hospital-Readmission-Prediction**
Final requirement for my machine learning and artificial intelligence course
*****************************************************************************
## **Project Overview**
  This project builds a **machine learning–based risk prediction system** to identify patients at high risk of **hospital readmission within 30 days.**
The goal is to support hospitals in **reducing avoidable readmissions**, improving care quality, and **mitigating CMS financial penalties** through data-driven decision-making.

  The model leverages patient demographics, comorbidities, medication usage, prior utilization, and clinical history to generate actionable risk scores that can be used for targeted post-discharge interventions.
